            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jenny from Sweden. I'm a skillcrush student in web development who are traveling around in the world. Start earning this was my best decision ever (after quitting my old job to travel of course)
               This fits me very well to dig down and build beautiful and clean web pages. To be a problem solver and a click away on the keyboard.
               My skills right now are HTML, CSS, Git/Github and some photoshop. And I will build on this with much more.<br><br>
               Check out my projects that skillcrush have given me down below.
               And of course I did build this page to :)</p>

                <p>This was my first website that I built with directions from skillcrush of course. It shows a clean, easy layout that is easy to look at and read.  </p>
